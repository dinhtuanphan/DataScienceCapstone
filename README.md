# About Data Science Capstone

The capstone project will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers. Projects will be drawn from real-world problems and will be conducted with industry, government, and academic partners.

### This course is part of multiple programs
This course can be applied to multiple Specializations or Professional Certificates programs. Completing this course will count towards your learning in any of the following programs:

- Data Science Specialization (10 courses in 11 months)
- Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization

### You are a data scientist now

The goal of this data science specialization has been to give you the basic skills involved with being a data scientist. The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity. 

### Course tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

You will hear about each of these tasks over the course of the capstone.
