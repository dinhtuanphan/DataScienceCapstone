# About Data Science Capstone

The capstone project will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers. Projects will be drawn from real-world problems and will be conducted with industry, government, and academic partners.

### This course is part of multiple programs
This course can be applied to multiple Specializations or Professional Certificates programs. Completing this course will count towards your learning in any of the following programs:

- Data Science Specialization (10 courses in 11 months)
- Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization

### You are a data scientist now

The goal of this data science specialization has been to give you the basic skills involved with being a data scientist. The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity. 

### Course tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

You will hear about each of these tasks over the course of the capstone.

### Milestone Report

The goal of this project is just to display that you've gotten used to working with the data and that you are on track to create your prediction algorithm. Please submit a report on [R Pubs](http://rpubs.com/) that explains your exploratory analysis and your goals for the eventual app and algorithm. This document should be concise and explain only the major features of the data you have identified and briefly summarize your plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app in a way that would be understandable to a non-data scientist manager. You should make use of tables and plots to illustrate important summaries of the data set. The motivation for this project is to:

1. Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
2. Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
3. Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
4. Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app.

### App Deveplopment

#### Data Product

1. Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
2. Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
3. When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
4. Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

#### Slide Deck

1. Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
2. Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
3. Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
4. How would you describe the experience of using this app?
5. Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
6. Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?
